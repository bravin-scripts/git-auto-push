It's tiresome having to write the same commands time and again on your 
terminal especially the git commands. 

This script is meant to reduce the time wasted writting the git commands
just to push the code haing to remember all the commands of which as a
beginner it can be confusing. Although I encaurage you to read through 
the git documentation and familiarize yourself with these commands and 
the errors that might occure just in case.

At the moment the script only includes options for "First Time Pushes" 
and "Subsequent Pushes". 

The "First Time Push" option handles pushes for a brand new local git 
folder, i.e from initialization (git init). While the "Subsequent Push" 
option handles pushes for an already configured local repository.
